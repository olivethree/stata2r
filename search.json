The language was inspired by the S language, which was developed at Bell Laboratories. R has since become a popular tool among statisticians and data scientists due to its extensive package ecosystem and active user community.",

Imagine a tech company, “InnovateTech,” which has recently launched a new interface design for its flagship software. The company is keen to understand whether this new design truly enhances user satisfaction compared to the old design.\nInnovateTech has invested significant resources into redesigning its software interface, aiming to make it more intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly. The old design, while functional, received mixed reviews from users, with common complaints about its complexity and outdated look. The new design promises a sleek, modern interface with improved navigation and enhanced features.\nTo validate the effectiveness of the new design, InnovateTech conducts a study involving a diverse group of users. Participants are randomly assigned to use either the old or the new interface for a week. At the end of the week, they complete a detailed satisfaction survey. The company hopes that the results will provide clear insights into whether the new design meets user expectations and enhances their overall experience.\nResearch Question: Does the new interface design improve user satisfaction compared to the old design?\nHypothesis: Users will report higher satisfaction scores with the new interface design compared to the old design.",

This suggests that there is evidence against the null hypothesis, implying a statistically significant difference between the satisfaction scores of the two groups. However, it does not measure the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false.\nConfidence interval: The confidence interval provides a range of values that, based on the sample data, is likely to contain the true mean difference between the groups. If we were to repeat the experiment many times, we would expect a specified proportion (e.g., 95%) of these intervals to contain the true mean difference. It does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the true mean difference lies within this specific interval.",
